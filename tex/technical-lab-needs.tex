\chapter{Specific Technical Needs of a School Laboratory} \index{Laboratory! technical needs}

Laboratories facilitate hands-on investigation of various phenomena. 
Every syllabus requires different topics for study, 
but a core of topics provide a good foundation for each subject.

\section{Basic Biology Laboratory}

A basic biology laboratory should allow the following investigations:

\end{itemize}

\section{Basic Chemistry Laboratory}

A basic chemistry laboratory should allow for the following investigations:
\begin{itemize}
\item{Distinguishing compounds from mixtures, 
preparing chemical compounds, separating mixtures}

evaporation/condensation, sublimation/deposition, 
dissolution/crystallization)}
\item{Comparison of metals and non-metals}
\item{Comparison of covalent and ionic (electrovalent) compounds}
\item{Observing various elements and compounds 
and their reactivity with air, water, acids and bases}

(conductivity, electrolysis, electroplating, voltage generation)}
\item{Volumetric analysis (titration)}
\item{Identification of unknown salts (``qualitative analysis'')}
\item{Very basic organic reactions 
(e.g. preparation of ethanol by fermentation, 
oxidation of ethanol to ethanal)}
\end{itemize}

Key materials are:
\begin{itemize}
\item{Containers, bottles, tubes, balloons}
